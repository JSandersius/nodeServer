this is the MDN local library express (node) tutorial

URL--> --> 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website


In this series of tutorial articles you will:

.Use the Express Application Generator tool to create a skeleton website and application.

.Start and stop the Node web server.

.Use a database to store your application's data.

.Create routes for requesting different information, and templates ("views") to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser.

.Work with forms.

.Deploy your application to production.

You have learnt about some of these topics already, and touched briefly on others. By the end of the tutorial series you should know enough to develop simple Express apps by yourself.


_________________
.In the first few tutorial articles we will define a        simple browse-only library that library members can     use to find out what books are available. This allows   us to explore the operations that are common to almost  every website: reading and displaying content from a database.

.As we progress, the library example naturally extends      to demonstrate more advanced website features. For      example we can extend the library to allow new books    to be created, and use this to demonstrate how to use forms, and support user authentication.
