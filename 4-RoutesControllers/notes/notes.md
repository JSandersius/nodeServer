In this tutorial we'll set up routes (URL handling code) with "dummy" handle functions for all the resource endpoints that we'l eventually need in the locallibrary website. on completion we'll have a modular structure fo our route handling code, which we can extend with real handler functions in the following articles. We'll also have a really good understanding of how to create modulat routes using Express!
